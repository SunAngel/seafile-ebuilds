# Ebuilds for Seafile Client for Gentoo Linux

Nothing to say here, just ebuilds for seafile as they aren't present in official repo.

To install seafile client you can run:
```sh
# emerge net-misc/seafile-client
```

There aslo some USE flags to configure building. 
This repo doesn't contain ebuilds for server version of Seafile because 
I don't have place to test them and also I prefer Docker for server side. 
[Here](https://hub.docker.com/r/sunx/seafile/) you can find my Docker image for Seafile server.
